- **CDN & Edge Caching**: Cloudflare for static assets, API response caching

**Smart Contract Deployment**
- **Deployment Order**:
  1. TempoToken.sol (ERC-20) on Ethereum mainnet
  2. TempoDePINFaucet V2 on all supported chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon)
  3. Verify contracts on Etherscan, Arbiscan, etc.
- **Initial Liquidity**:
  - Seed TempoDePINFaucet with 50 ETH across chains
  - Allocate 10M TEMPO for initial rewards (6-month supply)
- **Gas Optimization**: Test gas costs across all chains, optimize transaction batching

**Testnet Final Push**
- **Stress Testing**: Simulate 1,000 concurrent users, 10,000 daily transactions

## 4. Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### 4.1 User Acquisition Risks

**Risk: Slow User Growth**
- **Mitigation**: Increase early adopter bonuses (2x TEMPO rewards for first 500 users)
- **Pivot**: Focus on B2B partnerships (energy companies) for revenue if consumer adoption lags

**Risk: High CAC**
- **Mitigation**: Double down on organic channels (content, referrals)
- **Pivot**: Reduce paid ad spend, reallocate to influencer partnerships

### 4.2 Technical Risks

**Risk: Wormhole Downtime**
- **Mitigation**: Implement automatic failover to alternative bridges (Axelar, LayerZero)
- **Communication**: Transparent status page, proactive user notifications

**Risk: Smart Contract Bug**
- **Mitigation**: Emergency pause mechanism, insurance fund ($10K reserve)
- **Response**: Immediate audit, hot fix deployment within 24 hours

### 4.3 Market Risks

**Risk: Crypto Market Downturn**
- **Mitigation**: Emphasize stablecoin yields, conservative strategies
- **Pivot**: Market energy data sales (less crypto-dependent) as primary revenue

**Risk: Regulatory Crackdown on DeFi**
- **Mitigation**: Legal review of all features, geo-blocking if needed
- **Pivot**: White-label B2B solutions (less regulatory scrutiny)
